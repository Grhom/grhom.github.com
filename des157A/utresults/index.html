        Vlad enjoyed the dice animation and the overall design interface. He
        commented on the animations, graphics, and colors. Some feedback he gave
        aligns with the questions I had in mind for my user testing.

          >1. What do you think can be improved to indicate who won in the
          game?</span
        >
        <br />
        The winning indication is clear to Vlad because the sounds and graphics
        make it very intuitive. He enjoyed the bone visual and the puppy sounds
        that make it easy to show when someone wins.

        >
        <br />
        He emphasized how the main issue with the game was improving the
        interface to help indicate the player’s turn. I think what confused him
        the most was the bug in my game. I noticed how the opposite player would
        receive points from the player that is rolling the dice. This error made
        it confusing for him to understand whose turn it was. In other
        instances, it worked according to the player’s role, but I will go back
        and fix this issue.

        <br />
        He had some comments about the autocomplete and adding styling to the
        form field for the name to help match the theme I have.

      <p>
        Ali enjoyed the styling and the overall theme of the interface. She
        wanted the options she could interact with, such as the slider for the
        sound, the help icon to refer back to the instructions, and the alert
        for the user testing. Similar to Vlad, Ali commented on some of the
        questions I prepared for. In addition, she commented on the buttons and
        how they are all styled the same. The start button isn’t functional
        after you start the game, so I plan to remove it and only have the
        restart button to make it more straightforward for the user.

          >1. What do you think can be improved to indicate who won in the
          game?</span
        >
        <br />
        She commented on having words or a pop-up on the bottom of the screen
        when the roll button goes away to make it more straightforward for the
        user the game is over and a player has won. She mentioned that the game
        control area is the main focus and hot spot of the screen, making it
        more seamless to have an indicator in that screen section than the
        header.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >2. What do you think can be improved to indicate the player’s

        <br />
        Similarly, Ali commented to add pop-ups and text to clarify when the
        person’s turn has been switched.

        <br />
        Ali suggested adding styling to the name section and setting up the form
        as an active stater.

      <p>
        Cody also liked the interface and the designs of the game. The most
        important feedback I received that aligned with the other testers was
        the start button and the indication of the player’s turn. Cody also
        commented on more minor design details like padding and making the items
        on the page more centered aligned.

          >1. What do you think can be improved to indicate who won in the
          game?</span

        <br />
        He had no comments about the winning screen. He liked the visuals and
        thought the treat is a good indicator of who is receiving points and who
        wins the game after.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >2. What do you think can be improved to indicate the player’s
          turn?</span
        >
        <br />
        Similar to the other user tests, it was difficult to tell which player’s
        turn to roll the dice. Cody suggested making the border thicker and more
        prominent and making the other card more transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >3. How intuitive was it for you to enter your name before you played
          the game?</span
        >
        <br />
        Cody commented how he wouldn’t know that he needed to enter names for
        the players if I didn’t add the user test screens.
      </p>

    <section class="ut1">
      <h1><span>Final implementation</span></h1>
      <p>
        From the feedback I received, I plan to adjust the game controls and
        clarify indicators. For the game controls, all of the users were unsure
        which buttons to click. Once the user clicks on the "start" button, it
        should disappear and only show the "roll" button. I also want to
        rearrange the heirachy of the buttons and but the main focus on the roll
        button.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the indicators, there were confusions on the name fields and some
        confusions on who won the game. To make it more clear, I plan to
        seperate each step into separate screens than having many actions in one
        screen. After the user reads the instructions, one screen will appear
        with two scoreboards and they can only enter the player's name to
        continue. The next screen will be the game itseld
      </p>

      <p>
        To make the scoreboards more clear, I plan to stylie brighter and
        boldder colors to highlight the player's turn and use pop-up text that
        explicitly indicates it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, I will include an overlay of text on the bottom to indicate who
        won the game instead of leaving it on the header.
