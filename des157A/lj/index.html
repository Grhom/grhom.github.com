      <h1><span>Game Design</span> UX Best Practices </h1>
      <h3>November 10th, 2021</h3>
      <p>
        The article “Game Design UX Best Practices by Amir Dori” discusses different UI/UX principles that can help improve Game Designs through 250+ lessons learned from games and proven data. Some key takeaways I learned and will consider implementing in the game project: UI positions, sliders, popups, draggable objects, and an intro video! In particular, the concepts from UI positions, sliders, and popups were very insightful.
      </p>
      <p>

        UI positioning can help “comfort the ” hard-to-reach areas, depending on the orientation and placing interactive elements that can lead to monetization. Ideas that I never considered from the monetization of businesses are “Drak UX.” Some companies may use UX design principles that do not help the user. Instead, they use design principles to make the user experience increase the company’s revenue. 
      </p>

      <p>

        Sliders help expose many options without needing to navigate away from the main screen. 
        The best practices for sliders include partly visible items visible on screen, so users will know there is more content. Also, animating from end to start upon launch by scroll-reverse can help the users know there is more content on the other side. I thought these two learnings for me were exciting and compelling. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, popups usually include a default exit button at the top right corner. This user interface design is prevalent and something I see across all methods. However, according to Dori, it is not the most effective way to inform the users. Instead, due to patterns of annoyance, if the content has value, design a button as a choice with the monetization element placed on the right side.

           <p>
              This is a picture of my best friend and I hanging out in Davis under some cherry blossom trees. We tried to coordinate our outfits by using white and cream tone colors. I really like the photo because the pink and warm tones give a welcoming feel in the photo. The red bandana and the pink lips really stand out and give a contrast to the cherry blossoms in the backgrounds. There are no harsh shadows and you can clearly see our faces focused and centered in the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am using a series of images with my friend, Lauren! We both enjoy styling our clothes and taking photos together. In my project, I plan to use my closet and hover over the photos I used to take pictures of Luaren and I. Within each image, there is a series of images of activities we did that day and hover captions!
            </p>
            <p>
              My collection explains my common interests with my friend and highlights the memories I have! It tells a story of my relationship with my friend and a little bit about me as a person. The pictures I chose also display the clothes I like to wear and my personality.

          <figcaption>Fig.2 - UC Davis Bus Route, California</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        This image gives a birds-eye-view of the buses and bus stops near the memorial union. There are people walking on campus, giving some insight of what UC Davis students experience on campus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The perspective is very interesting, it gives the image a similar view of a map. It is displaying the possible routes the bus will take and the locations of their stops. I like the arrows on the roads, pointing the directions of which way the buses move. The color of the red buses makes it really stand out against the earthy tones of the picture. The warm natural tones from the light gives a happy feeling to the image. The blue shadows gives more interesting shapes and patterns on the picture that can give it more contrast and details. The small figures of people walking towards the bus adds more personality to the picture: instead of stagnant buses, we see some interactions of people using the bus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The most obvious aspects of the image is the theme. I can tell it is about bus routes by the way the photo is taken and the emphasis is on the bus based on the colors of the image. I think the photo can use some editing on the lighting to make it more cohsive, and brightening the reds of the buses to draw more attention to it. The details of the blue shadows can be clashing and a little bit distrcting against the red buses. The most mysterious aspect of the image is the three buses ligned up against the side walk. I wonder what they are for and why it is parked there. Do the buses take turns with different bus shifts? I am also curious where the routes will go once the picture is implemented in the project. The image only presents the possible routes it could take and the locations of the bus stops, but doesnt point to where each bus should go. I am excited to see where the project is heading!

          10 Intriguing photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking
          Skills <span>Exploring Website Ideas</span>
        </h1>
        <h3>October 27th, 2021</h3>
        <h2>Articulation of thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          The article offers different ideas to help people engage with images
          and better understand how to use them through exercising their reading
          and visual skills. It is important to look at images closely and pay
          attention to detail. Practicing regularly and see what is going on in
          the picture helps us exercise these skills. An exercise like “What’s
          Going On?,” selects parts of the photo to help practice close reading.
          Asking open ended questions helps us adapt to different subjects and
          expand our knowledge about the world around us. Not only observing
          images closely, but being able to communicate and foster convocation
          about the photos and sharing new ideas! Some ideas I have in mind from
          looking at the awwwards website, I really enjoyed “The Shift”. It
          includes horizontal and diagonal scrolling. I also enjoy looking at
          the micro interactions: hovering, bolded shapes, moving boxes, and fun
          videos. I also liked that a dot or images follow the moving mouse. It
          can be kind of distracting with too many interactions going on, so I
          will make sure to limit them. If I am able to understand the code
          better, I hope to add a magnifying interaction and highlight some
          parts of the images I provide for the project to make the images and
          pictures be more fun and engaging!

         <span>Overuse of Overlays:</span>  How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes
        </h1>
        <h3>October 23, 2021</h3>

        <h2>Articulation of Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          An overlay is a content box that is displayed at the top of a page and
          is smaller than the underlying page. Usually, the ackground is
          obscured which explains the term 'lightbox' to described the oerall
          emphasis of the effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor use of overlays can be frustrating for users, making an upleasent
          experence. The Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) reminds us to think about
          the 5W's such as "Who, What, When, Where, and Why" to help determine
          if an overlay is appropaite for the design and when to implement the
          solution. The intention of overlays is to provide a way of quick
          access to important information. It is also for the designer's
          convenince, giving more features without making more features.
        </p>
        <p>
          NN/g organized their article by targeting all of the W’s to understand
          when to use overlays in the most effective way. Designers should think
          about who my target audience is. For instance, designing a overlay
          function that is designed for desktops and placing it in a mobile
          application can be confusing and disorienting for the audience: think
          about the accessibilit and low-vision. Also, designers need to
          determine what action users will take and make sure the experience is
          quick and simple decision. Examples can include confirmation action,
          cancellations, or saving items. A challenge with using overlays is
          when and where to use it. Usually, designers should place the feature
          when users are less likely to interact with the task that is inline of
          the user’s sight. Lastly, designers should know why they are using an
          overlay. It is important to only use it when it is essential and
          urgent to collect small amounts of data! I really enjoyed the examples
          and case studies for each of these points, making it clear for me when
          building websites in the future.

        <h1>20 Best Practices <br />for <span>form Design</span></h1>
        <h3>October 18th, 2021</h3>

        <h2>Articulation of Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          In the article, “20 best practices for form design,” the list
          structure of different points needed to optimize form design was very
          clear and easy to follow. Implementing these best practices and ideas
          helps improve the user experience. Some key takeaways that I learned
          from the article are column layouts, minimizing information, the order
          of information, and increasing accessibility. Minimizing input fields
          can help avoid unnecessary questions and only ask relevant
          information. Less information can help give a more pleasant experience
          for the user. Also, breaking down the information using the format,
          size inputs, the proximity of labels, and minimizing blocks of text
          can help reduce cognitive overload.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback is also great for user experience, providing users a clear
          notice of whether they filled in inputs correctly or if their forms
          are submitted or need more changes, I find feedback forms helpful, as
          they instruct me what I need to do to complete the form. I also have
          an appreciation for minimal forms, as they are aesthetically pleasing
          and also give the most simple and direct experience for me.
        </p>

        <h2>Airbnb Form</h2>
        <p>
          The User Interface of Airbnb is a great example of forms: allowing
          people to book a place to stay and also creating trust between two
          strangers. During the initial search, the only fields you need to
          specify are choosing a destination users would like to go to, the
          duration of their stay, and the number of guests. The practice is
          friendly, simple, and streamlined.
