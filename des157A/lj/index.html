          <h2>Articulation of Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            In the article, “20 best practices for form design,” the list
            structure of different points needed to optimize form design was
            very clear and easy to follow. Implementing these best practices and
            ideas helps improve the user experience. Some key takeaways that I
            learned from the article are column layouts, minimizing information,
            the order of information, and increasing accessibility. Minimizing
            input fields can help avoid unnecessary questions and only ask
            relevant information. Less information can help give a more pleasant
            experience for the user. Also, breaking down the information using
            the format, size inputs, the proximity of labels, and minimizing
            blocks of text can help reduce cognitive overload.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feedback is also great for user experience, providing users a clear
            notice of whether they filled in inputs correctly or if their forms
            are submitted or need more changes, I find feedback forms helpful,
            as they instruct me what I need to do to complete the form. I also
            have an appreciation for minimal forms, as they are aesthetically
            pleasing and also give the most simple and direct experience for me.

          <h2>Airbnb Form</h2>
          <p>
            The User Interface of Airbnb is a great example of forms: allowing
            people to book a place to stay and also creating trust between two
            strangers. During the initial search, the only fields you need to
            specify are choosing a destination users would like to go to, the
            duration of their stay, and the number of guests. The practice is
            friendly, simple, and streamlined.
