      <h1><span>Project Summary</span></h1>
      <p>
        My project topic will be on “The Game of Dog(Pig)” and I am going to
        finish and update the game by adding the requirements needed and
        additional changes I plan to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to find some websites that have similar objectives, goals, and
        interactions as my game. It was difficult to find a dog rolling dice
        game, so instead I added comparisons of different content and ideas that
        lead to the current game idea I have.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison Project 1:</h2>
      <p>
        Website:<a
          href="https://www.online-stopwatch.com/chance-games/roll-a-dice/"
          >Linked here</a
        >
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/dice.png" alt="dog" />
        <figcaption>Fig.2 - vicious dog game</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The first website is a rolling dice concept. I really enjoyed how
        interactive the dice is and the animations and sounds that mimic what a
        real life dice should look like. Other than the dice interaction, the
        page is very blank and there are too many ads and colors that are
        clustered and very distracting to me. The current Game of Pig website is
        very simple and has minimal interactions that can have more engagement
        for the user. I wanted to incorporate this animation into my rolling
        dice each time it was the player’s turn to make the interaction feel
        more lively.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison Project 2:</h2>
      <p>
        Website:
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/YTXTT-Electric-Tricky-Vicious-Children/dp/B0881MML4N?th=1"
          >Linked here</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The next content that inspired my game is the “Electric Tricky Vicious”
        dog game. The goal of the game is to grab as many bones before the dog
        will notice and will bite your hand. It is a game that I used to play
        when I was younger at school. I enjoy the concept of the game and wanted
        to incorporate it into the rolling dice game. In terms of the user
        interface design of the product, the dog looks very intimidating and
        does not match the aesthetic of what I plan to incorporate. The colors
        are loud and very bold, which can distract the user when they are trying
        to focus on rolling the dice. I didn’t follow the colors of the dog and
        incorporated colors and drawings that I was inspired from past corgi
        products I have used.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
      <p>
        The two projects I listed out are both very engaging and interactive
        with the user. The dice game realistically integrates sounds and
        animations to mimic someone rolling a dice. Similarly, the Electric
        Vicious dog game incorporates sounds and people to interact with objects
        that would trigger a dog in real life. They both have bold colors that
        are clashing and very distracting to play with. Instead, I plan to use
        softer colors and more bolded colors for CTA buttons and the dices to
        highlight the main points of the game. I plan to include sounds and
        animations that incorporate the dog and rolling dice interactions in my
        game to make it engaging and fun for the users to play with.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
      <p>
        I will use bolder colors to highlight and emphasize important
        instructions, buttons, and objects for the users to pay attention to.
        Also, using information hierarchy will make it easy for users to read
        and understand what will be presented in the game. Incorporating
        interactive elements such as hover effects, overlays, pop-ups, and
        transitions will give good indications of what is happening in the game
        to the user. The typography will be simple, as it will not distract the
        main content from the game and effectively communicate to the user what
        is happening. Along with the simple typeface, the game will have a
        minimal design by having a balance of negative space around every
        object. Lastly, different states of buttons and animations will give
        even more indication and communication to the user.
      </p>

      <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
      <p>
        Some interactions I plan to incorporate is a timer for the dices when
        they roll on each turn, animations when the dices are clicked to give
        the game more movements, sound effects for both the dog and the dices,
        and pop-ups to help indicate turns and the outcomes of the game.
        Implementing these visual and sound effects will give cues to the user
        and give a more pleasant experience! There is also an interactive form
        where users type their names in the scoreboard. Also, each time the user
        wins a point, a bone will appear in their bowl. If the dog gets angry
        and realizes you took their bone (each time you miss your turn, receive
        a one, or snake eyes) a bone will be taken away from the player’s bowl,
        but the score will remain the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the game is to try to receive as many points as they can as
        they roll their dice on their turns. It might also incentivize users to
        not take food from dogs, otherwise they might get upset! Overall, I want
        my players to enjoy the game and have fun with the other players they
        are competing with.
